# STM32
 STM32 bare metal
 Stm32 projects without using HAL
 I am tryimg to learn programming stm by writing my own libraries I don't hate HAL
 but I don't want to use it and I think if you write my own libraries you learn whats really
 going on behind the curtain.

I dont like to use an IDE because they are unnecessary complex and heavy,
so I am using STM32-base (https://github.com/STM32-base)'s template
but Ä± make some changes on them sooner or later I'll write my own makefile, linker, etc.
All of the codes are can build in both windows and linux you just need to make few adjustments
these occurs because I am not familiar wiht makefiles so much but if you wanna contribute be my guest.
