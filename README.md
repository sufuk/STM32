# STM32
 STM32 bare metal
 Stm32 projects without using HAL
 I am trying to learn programming stm by writing my own libraries I don't hate HAL
 but I don't want to use it and I think if you write my own libraries you learn whats really
 going on behind the curtain.

I dont like to use an IDE because they are unnecessary complex and heavy. I edited some other
people's makefiles so that part not written all by me but sooner or later I'll write my own makefile
because this one is a mess right now.
